            <h1>Call For Papers</h1>
            

           <h2>Overview</h2>
           <p>Enterprise-scale cloud platforms and services systems, present common and cross-cutting challenges in maximizing power efficiency and performance while maintaining predictable and reliable behavior, and at the same time responding appropriately to environmental and system changes such as hardware failures and varying workloads. Autonomic computing systems address the challenges in managing these environments by integrating monitoring, decision-processing and actuation capabilities to autonomously manage resources and applications based on high-level policies.

          Research in cloud and autonomic computing spans a variety of areas, from computer, architecture, middleware services, databases and data-stores, and networks to machine learning and control theory. The purpose of the Fourth International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing (ICCAC) is to bring together researchers and practitioners across these disciplines to address the multiple facets of self-management in computing systems and applications.

          Papers are solicited on a broad array of topics of relevance to cloud and autonomic computing and their intersections, particularly those that bear on connections and relationships among different research areas or report on prototype systems or experiences. The goal is to confirm a premier international forum focused on the latest research, applications, and technologies aimed at making cloud and autonomic computing systems and services easy to design, to deploy and to implement, while achieving the simultaneous goals to be self-manageable, self-regulating and scalable with little involvement of human or system administrators.

          <h2>Paper/Poster Submission and Publication</h2>
          <p>
          Full papers (a maximum of 12 pages in length), industrial experience reports (a maximum of 8 pages) and posters (a maximum of 4 pages) are invited on a wide variety of topics relating to cloud and autonomic computing as indicated above. All papers must follow the IEEE proceedings format. All manuscripts will be reviewed and judged on merits including originality, significance, interest, correctness, clarity, and relevance to the broader community. Papers are strongly encouraged to report experiences, measurements, and user studies, and to provide an appropriate quantitative evaluation.

          Submitted papers must include original work, and may not be under consideration for another conference or journal. They should also not be under review or be submitted to another forum during the CAC 2016 review process. Authors should submit full papers or posters electronically following the instructions from the CAC 2016 conference web site. Accepted papers and posters will appear in proceedings distributed at the conference and available electronically. Authors of accepted papers/poster are expected to present their work at the conference.
          </p>

          <b>Authors are also encouraged to submit a poster or demo that summarizes and highlights the main points of their paper.</b>
