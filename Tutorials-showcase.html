<h4>
  Tutorial Description
</h4>
<p>
Over the last few years, context-aware Information Fusion (IF) has gained increasing attention. Contextual Information (CI) can be understood as the information that “surrounds” an observable of interest, possibly influencing its state or even the sensing and estimation processes themselves.
</p>
<p>
The development of IF systems, to include data-, sensor-, and feature-level fusion, is a necessary engineering process in diverse applications, and new domains are more and more requiring an increasing degree of contextualized solutions and situation-adaptation mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
Typical advantages provided by the exploitation of CI include constrained estimates, refined inferences, and process adaptation.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, understanding and exploiting CI can be a key element for improving the performance of IF algorithms and automatic systems in general that have to deal with varying operating conditions.
</p>
<p>
Application examples include: context-aided surveillance systems (security/defence), traffic control, autonomous navigation, cyber security, ambient intelligence, ambient assistance, etc.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this tutorial is to survey existing approaches for context-enhanced IF, covering the design and development of solutions integrating sensory data with contextual knowledge.
</p>
<p>
After discussing CI in other domains, the tutorial will focus on context representation and exploitation aspects for IF systems.
The applicability of the presented approaches will be illustrated in fusion processes at different levels: from target tracking to situation assessment and reasoning.
</p>

<h4>Topics will include</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Representation and exploitation of contextual information at different levels of an IF system</li>
  <li>Managing of heterogeneous contextual sources</li>
  <li>Adaptation techniques to have the system respond not only to changing target’s state but also to the surrounding environment</li>
  <li>Architectural issues and possible solutions</li>
  <li>Augmentation of tracking and situation assessment algorithms with contextual information</li>
</ul>

<h4>
  Intended audience
</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Computer scientists</li>
  <li>Students</li>
  <li>Information Fusion practitioners</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tutorial Description</h4>
<p>
The concept of a situation is central to the situation management community. Still, the concept is not clearly defined and, often, research on the topic rarely refer to the definition of situation that the research is based on. This is probably because the concept of a situation is elusive and a common definition has not been agreed on. The tutorial will start with an introduction to different definitions of the concept of a situation, so that the audience can get a better grasp of complexities related to defining situations. The definitions will be analyzed and a definition that bring these together will be discussed. A formal framework for describing situations based on the proposed definition will presented. The framework will be used to discuss situations that develop over time, observers and situations, future situations, the concept of history, explanations and justifications of predictions.
</p>

<p>
The three sub-processes of situation assessment is described in Endsley’s three situation awareness levels. However, while the levels are given detailed descriptions, they are not related directly to any definition of the concept of a situation. By analyzing the concept of a situation in relation to the situation awareness levels, the situation awareness levels can be decomposed further into more fine grained levels. These fine-grained levels are described as a knowledge level model of situation assessment that includes a task tree, a goal analysis and detailed task description. The knowledge level model is used to enhance and detail Endsley’s three levels of situation awareness model.
</p>

<p>
The concept of context is an elusive one as well. Bazire and Brezillon have analyzed 150 definitions of context found on the web, and  some of these definitions will be reviewed. The definitions will be discussed and analyzed in relation to the concepts situation and situation assessment. Furthermore, the role of context in situation assessment will be analysed, and a context element ontology will be presented. A formal framework for describing situation assessment will be presented.
</p>

<p>
Examples of how the knowledge level model and the formal framework can be used to analyze domains will be given. Two different use cases will analyzed using the methods presented, and these are oil well drilling and emergency services. Both use cases are interesting because the situations are assessed remotely by the observers the analyses focus on. The drilling engineers assess the situation in the wellbore, which can be 10 000 feet below the drilling rig, indirectly through interpreting real-time measurements. Emergency call centre operators assess situations through callers describing emergencies over the phone. The examples include situation descriptions, task and goal analyses, a discussion of context elements and the role of context
</p>

<h4>Intended Audience</h4>
<p>
The intended audience is everyone that is interested in situation management, as the tutorial provides an introduction and overview to central concepts in situation awareness and situation assessment. However, the knowledge level model is most suited for researchers and software developers that develop systems that perform situation assessment and need to model situations.
