<h4>FAS*W 2016 (SASO AND ICCAC)</h4>
<h1>Call for Workshop Proposals</h1>

<p>2016 IEEE 1st International Workshops on Foundations and Applications of Self* Systems (FAS*W), Augsburg, Germany, September 12 &amp; 16, 2016 </br> 

<a href="http://fasstar2016.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/" target="_blank">http://fasstar2016.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/</a></br> 
<a href="http://iccac2016.se.rit.edu/" target="_blank">http://iccac2016.se.rit.edu/</a></br> 
<a href="http://saso2016.informatik.uni-augsburg.de" target="_blank">http://saso2016.informatik.uni-augsburg.de</a></br> 

</p>
<p>=========================================================================</p>
<p>(Please accept our apologies if you receive multiple copies of this call)</p>
<p>The FAS* 2016 Steering Committee invites proposals for the Workshop Program to be held along with the technical conferences SASO 2016 and ICCAC 2016. FAS*W workshops will provide a meeting for presenting novel ideas in a less formal and possibly more focused way than the conferences them-selves. Their aim is to stimulate and facilitate active exchange, interaction, and comparison of approaches, methods, and ideas related to specific topics, both theoretical and applied, in the general area of Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems as well as Cloud and Autonomic Computing. To motivate the discussion and participation of all the workshop attendants, we encourage organizers to get away of the typical "mini-conference" format of a workshop, and include more discussion sessions, panels, etc. Members from all areas of the SASO and ICCAC communities are invited to submit workshop proposals for review. Workshops on global challenges, applications or on new and emerging topics are particularly encouraged. Workshops can vary in length, but most will be one full day in duration. Optionally, if desired by the organizers, workshop proceedings can be published through IEEE. Attendance of workshops will be included in the registration fee for the main SASO/ICCAC conference</p>

<h4>FAS*W 2016 Workshops - Requirements for Submission</h4>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>


<p>Proposals for workshops should be separated in two parts. The <b>first part</b> should be organized as preliminary call for papers or call for participation, depending on the intended format of the workshop, with a maximum of two pages and contain the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Title of the workshop.</li>
  <li>A brief technical description of the workshop, specifying the workshop goals, the technical is-sues that it will address, and the relevance of the workshop to the main conferences. Please specify, which of the two main conferences the workshop assigned to (if any)!</li>
  <li>Description of paper review process (if any) and acceptance standards in order to keep the workshop high in quality. Note that papers must be in the same format as the conference proceedings and may not be more than 6 pages in length.</li>
  <li>The names, affiliations, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of the pro-posed workshop organizing committee. This committee should consist of three or four people knowledgeable about the technical issues to be addressed. The organizing committee should include individuals from multiple institutions.</li>
  <li>The primary email address for contacting the organizing committee.</li>
  <li>Expected duration of the workshop (half or full day).</li>
  <li>A brief description of the workshop format.</li>

<p>The <b>second part</b> with a maximum of three pages should contain additional information not suitable for a Call for Papers, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A discussion of why and to whom the workshop is of interest.</li>
  <li>A list of related workshops held within the last three years, if any, and their relation to the pro-posed workshop.</li>

  <li>An indication of the envisaged acceptance rate (if applicable).</li>
  <li>A description of the qualifications of the individual committee members with respect to organizing a SASO or ICCAC workshop, including a list of workshops previously arranged by any members of the proposed organizing committee, if any.</li>
  <li>A list of places (distribution lists, web sites, journals, etc.) where the workshop is planned to be advertised.</li>
</ul>


<p>All proposals should be submitted in plain ASCII text or PDF format by electronic mail to the FAS*W 2016 Workshop Chairs, via Monika Lorenz, as described below.</p>


<p>The selection of the workshops to be included in the final FAS* 2016 Workshop program will be based upon multiple factors, including:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the scientific/technical interest of the topics,</li>
 <li>the quality of the proposal,</li>
 <li>complementarity with the conference topics,</li>
 <li>balance and distinctness of workshop topics, and </li>
 <li>the capacity of the conference workshop program.</li>


</ul>

<p>Note that authors of proposals addressing similar and/or overlapping content areas and/or audiences may be requested to merge their proposals.</p>



<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<h4>Responsibilities of FAS* 2016 Workshop Organizers</h4>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>


<p>For all accepted proposals, FAS* 2016 will be responsible for:</p>

  <li>Providing logistical support and a meeting place for the workshops.</li>
  <li>Together with the organizers, determining the workshop date and time.</li>
  <li>Liaising and coordinating between the workshop chairs and the finance chair, publicity chair, registration chair, and web chair for FAS*.</li>

<br>

<p>Workshop organizers will be responsible for the following:</p>
